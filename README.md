# Dynamic Shader Project

This repository contains the Dynamic Shader Development Project, a key component of the CPSC 314: Computer Graphics course at University of British Columbia, completed in November 2023. The project showcases advanced techniques in shader programming and interactive graphics rendering within a WebGL environment. Key features include custom vertex and fragment shaders for 3D object rendering with a focus on cartoon-style effects for a torus object, improved texture mapping using three.js/WebGL filters, dynamic light source manipulation through keyboard inputs, and an innovative shader feature for simulating animated ripple effects on object surfaces. This project demonstrates practical skills in WebGL, GLSL, and JavaScript, emphasizing interactive 3D graphics and real-time rendering enhancements.
